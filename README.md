MNIST For ML Beginners trains a simple model that classifies handwritten numbers using Softmax Regression. Accuracy: ~92%



Deep MNIST for Experts trains a more complex model that also classifies handwritten numbers, but uses a Multilayer Convolutional Network in an attempt to improve accuracy. Accuracy: ~99.3%
